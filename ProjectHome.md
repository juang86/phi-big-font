The Phi\_big\_font library utilizes 3 X 5 dot matrix technique I developed to display characters 6 times the size of ordinary characters seen on HD44780-compatible character LCDs. The Phi\_super\_font library utilizes 5 X 7 dot matrix technique I developed to display characters 40 times the size of ordinary characters seen on HD44780-compatible character LCDs. Almost all characters are included, not just big numbers. I will consider combining these two libraries into one version with choice of either big or super size characters but due to the HD44780 limitations one can't have both displayed at the same time.
